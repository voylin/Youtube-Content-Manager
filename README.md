# Youtube-Content-Manager
Just a simple program to keep track of all scripts I'm making for my youtube video's, feel free to also use it ;)

To install this: Install Godot, open the project and export to the right os (windows/linux/mac).

I can't share the exports themself because they exceed the 24mb capacity.
